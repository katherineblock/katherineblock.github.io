     Hi, my name is Katie Block. I currently live in Lexington, Kentucky and this is my final semester of the library and information science program. I have taken a short four hour class online about HTML coding through Codecademy, but that is all of my previous web development training. However, my boyfriend is a software engineer, so I have some random knowledge of how different programming languages work. I hope by the end of this course, I am able to create or edit webpages for our library. I would also like to have a basic understanding how everything works, so I’m not as confused when talking to others! I work as a Children’s Services Outreach Librarian, so I don’t do a ton of website stuff, but I would like to have the skills to do so if needed. My favorite hobby right now is crafting. I love to make things and recently started crocheting!
