            <h2> Student Learning Objective 1</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Graduates will apply the core principles, ethics, values, and body of knowledge to questions in library and information science, according to their area of specialty.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The first student learning outcome of the Library and Information Science program sets the foundation for the remaining outcome and of the library science profession as a whole. Librarians must understand and uphold the principles, ethics, and values to better serve the patron and the community. Librarians must be able to evaluate and analyze sources of knowledge, defend intellectual freedom, effectively communicate with others, and be ready to adjust and grow along with changes within the field. The artifact I have chosen to display is an annotated bibliography I created on intellectual freedom and censorship.</p>
            
            <p>This annotated bibliography informs the reader of what intellectual freedom and censorship mean, while also providing first-hand accounts of situations regarding these principles. It also discusses self-censorship and how some librarians censor material without knowing they do so. This assignment taught me more about intellectual freedom and made me more aware of how easily censorship can happen. It has especially made me focus on not self-censoring information and informing others of how they may be self-censoring.</p>

            <h2> Student Learning Objective 2</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Graduates will apply management principles and interdisciplinary best practices in library and information agency environments.</li>
            </ul>
             
            <p>The second student learning outcome of the Library and Information Science program focuses on managing and maintaining the information organization or institution. The ability to problem solve, plan, and collaborate are imperative to successful leadership roles. This student learning outcome makes sure that the library and information science students understand the importance of making critical decisions for an organization. The artifact I have chosen to display my knowledge of SLO 2 is a grant proposal for continuing education.</p>
            
            <p>While the grant proposal was never submitted for the actual Show Me Steps grant, the grant application itself is the real application for the 2020 year. Before this assignment, I had never written a grant and had no clue how to go about earning one. According to SLO 2, graduates must be able to provide direction for future development and grants are the perfect method to exemplify this quality. I now feel that if I was interested in new technology or in attending a conference in order to continue my education, I would be able to write a strong grant and advocate for library funding.</p>

            <h2> Student Learning Objective 3</h2>
            <ul> 
                <li>Graduates will be competent in information organization and lifecycle activities techniques of organization of information and with using and evaluating technologies of the information professions.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The third student learning outcome of the Library and Information Science program deals with competency in information organization and the various technologies of the profession. As new technologies emerge and old ones evolve, the library science profession has had to work diligently to understand these new advances. This student learning outcome guarantees that Master of Library and Information Science graduates are knowledgeable on using technology and are able to evaluate their effectiveness. The artifact I chose to display is a LibGuide on horse racing that I designed in Reference Sources and Services. </p>
            
            <p>Prior to this assignment, I had never heard of a LibGuide. To begin, we were able to choose our own topic and audience. I had to evaluate various materials to determine if they were adequate to be in the guide, as well as create a voiceover to introduce my guide. Organizing the LibGuide has allowed me to better understand how formatting can impact a patron's frustration level and affect overall usability. This assignment also taught me how to create a screen cast, which is extremely helpful in showing others how to navigate a web page or system. When creating a future LibGuide, I would provide better organization and usability to the guide. </p>
