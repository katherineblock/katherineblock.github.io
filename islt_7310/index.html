    <h3>About Me</h3>
    
    <p>I received my undergraduate degree in elementary education from Western Kentucky University. I now currently reside in Lexington, Kentucky and work as a Children’s Services Outreach Librarian for the Jessamine County Public Library. I have worked at the library for approximately three years and enjoy hosting programs and events to foster early literacy. Outside of work, my hobbies include crafting and spending time outdoors. I love challenging myself by learning new skills and putting them to the test! </p>
