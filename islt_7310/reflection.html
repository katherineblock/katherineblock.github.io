        <p>During my time in the Library and Information Science program, I have learned a great amount of information. At the same time as I enrolled in the program at the University of Missouri two years ago, I accepted a position as a Children’s Services Outreach Librarian. Prior to this, I had only worked in a public library for three months. I did not know much about librarianship or information science as a whole, but I did have prior knowledge of teaching and childhood development. This program allowed me to match my two levels of knowledge and use them harmoniously in my day to day position.</p>
        
        <p>I love my outreach position, but am eager to make more of a difference and to use my knowledge from the program to an even greater extent. I feel as if this program has prepared me for any obstacle or change that is thrown my way. I have not in any way learned all that accompanies library science, nor has anyone, but I have learned how to problem-solve more efficiently and how to find out any piece of information I need. This program has also shown me that my heart lies within the community and user services. It is my goal to continue working and meeting the needs of the community through information science, whether that is in the children’s library or elsewhere. I am extremely thankful for my time here at Mizzou and look forward to the future.</p>
